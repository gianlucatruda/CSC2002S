# CSC2002S-ParallelProgramming

Read the [whitepaper](http://bit.ly/parallelismPaper).

The aim of this assignment was to use the Java Fork/Join Framework to implement parallel
versions of both the Mergesort and Quicksort algorithms for sorting arrays of integers, and to
quantify both the speedup and correctness of these implementations across three different
architectures.
